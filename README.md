# findById
[![No Maintenance

Sometimes you have an array of JS objects & you just wanna `findById`
y'know? You could use [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs#find), [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#find) or any number of other packages to find objects by ID & much more, but if you *just* want to find by ID, `findById` is the kiddo.

## Why?
I needed this function for a node workshop & I didn't want to introduce lodash just
then for the single function. The lesson was on Express so searching collections
of objects was ~~tangential~~ **orthogonal** to the content we were focusing on.
Just wanted a nice, easy, `findById` function.
